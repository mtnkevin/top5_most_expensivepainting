        The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, is one of the most famous and studied artworks in the world. It shows a woman, thought to be Lisa Gherardini, seated against a distant, hazy landscape. Her gentle smile, known as the "Mona Lisa smile," is famous for its mysterious quality, appearing to change depending on the viewer’s angle or mood. Da Vinci used a technique called sfumato—a soft blending of colors without harsh lines—to give her face a lifelike, almost three-dimensional look. This, along with the detailed background, adds depth and realism to the portrait. The Mona Lisa is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, drawing millions of visitors each year who are captivated by her timeless beauty and enigmatic expression.</h3>

        Salvator Mundi, meaning "Savior of the World," is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci that depicts Christ holding a crystal orb in his left hand and raising his right in a gesture of blessing. Painted around 1500, it showcases da Vinci’s skill in creating lifelike textures and expressions. The crystal orb is symbolic, representing the heavens or the universe. The painting was lost for many years, only to resurface and be restored in the 21st century. In 2017, it gained attention as the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction, drawing both admiration and debate about its authenticity and condition.

        Interchange, painted by Dutch-American artist Willem de Kooning in 1955, is an Abstract Expressionist work known for its intense colors and dynamic brushstrokes. The painting suggests figures and landscapes in an abstract way, with vibrant shades of pink, orange, and yellow blending with contrasting blues. De Kooning’s expressive, almost aggressive brushwork invites viewers into a world of movement and color. The painting reflects the energy of post-war America and the artist's deep exploration of form and emotion, making it a significant piece in modern art. In 2015, Interchange became one of the most expensive paintings ever sold, underscoring its importance in art history.

        The Card Players is part of a series by French Post-Impressionist Paul Cézanne, painted between 1890 and 1895. This series shows peasants intensely focused on a quiet card game, reflecting everyday life in Provence. Cézanne’s technique—bold color blocks and expressive brushstrokes—highlights the figures' solidity and weight. The minimal background draws attention to the players’ postures and expressions. The series is noted for its simplicity and the artist's fascination with form, light, and perspective, bridging traditional and modern art approaches.

            Painted by American artist Jackson Pollock in 1948, Number 17A is an example of his "drip" technique, where he splattered and poured paint onto the canvas. Pollock's energetic lines and vibrant colors create an abstract composition that feels almost musical in rhythm and movement. This painting captures the essence of Abstract Expressionism, allowing viewers to interpret the chaos and energy as they like. Pollock’s approach was groundbreaking at the time, as it rejected traditional forms and embraced pure, spontaneous expression.
